							<h2>Research Methods and Professional Practice</h2><br>
						</header>	
						<p>
							The Research Methods and Professional Practice module at the University of Essex Online aims to provide a practical foundation in research methods that will enable students to conduct research in a practical setting. The module covers various tools and techniques that a researcher may need and allows for feedback throughout the module through cases and project tasks. The module also provides essential insight into the legal, social, ethical and professional issues applicable to computing projects, as well as the relevant codes of practice and practices.
						</p>
						<p>
							Furthermore, the module servers as a preparation for the MSc Capstone Project. As one of the project outcomes, a research proposal should be created that can help formulate the project proposal for the underlying Master's Thesis.
						</p>

					<p>
						The Research Methods and Professional Practice (RMPP) module included two separate rounds of discussion amongst the peers. The module began with a discussion round surrounding codes of ethics and professional conduct that apply to computing professionals. Using a case study from a list of examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery, the application of the ethics code should be reviewed to the situation described and the impact on any relevant legal and social issues should be highlighted. I have chosen the “Malware Disruption” case as an example of how both the ACM Codes of Ethics and the BCS Code of Conduct are impacted by the described incident.

					<p>
						The second round of discussions surrounded the importance of the accuracy of information when doing research. We were given a fictitious scenario consisting of Abi, a statistical programmer and researcher, who has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal (Whizzz). Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that the product is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that it is harmful. We were tasked to highlight ethical and legal concerns about his precarious situation. On one hand, it is Abi’s professional duty to conduct the data analysis as objectively and ethically as possible. On the other hand, the research project is funded by the manufacturer who expects a certain outcome.

						<h3 style="margin-bottom: 24px;margin-top: -1em;color:#1F3864">Literature Review</h3>
					

					<p>
						The first summative assessment in the scope of the module was to critically evaluate existing literature, research design and methodology for a chosen topic and then produce a literature review. We were allowed to select the topic from a provided list and to submit an outline of our literature review prior to submitting the assessment to receive formative feedback on the submission.
					</p>

					<p>
						I chose to write my literature review on the topic “Application of Microservice Architecture in the Development of Web Applications”. In the scope of Unit 4, I submitted my literature review outline to receive feedback.
					</p>

					<p>
						The feedback I received helped me to fine-tune my submission regarding content and format. I ensured to reduce the individual subchapters to be able to discuss the core content on a level of deeper debate. The feedback also included an emphasis on discussion and debate, so I made sure to apply a greater focus on highlighting conflicting literature, for instance regarding the performance comparison of monolithic systems versus microservices.

					<section id="research_proposal">
						<h3 style="margin-bottom: 24px;margin-top: -1em;color:#1F3864">Research Proposal Presentation</h3>
					

					<p>
						The second core deliverable for the RMPP module consisted of producing and critically evaluating a research proposal for a chosen topic. The final deliverable included an audio-narrated slide presentation and a transcript in which the proposal is presented. The topic could be based on the literature review we had previously submitted or the topic of our MSc capstone project.
					</p>

					<p>
						I chose to base my proposal on my capstone project as this would allow me to work ahead and lay the foundation for my thesis. Through meetings with my preferred supervisor, we narrowed down the topic choices and ultimately landed upon homomorphic encryption and how it can be utilised within the Internet of Things (IoT) to overcome current privacy and security concerns. We were once again encouraged to submit an outline for our research proposal beforehand to receive feedback.

					<p>
						<i>“Each and every researcher should have some knowledge in Statistics and must use statistical tools in his or her research”</i> (Begum & Ahmed, 2015: 50).
					</p>
					<p>
						During this module, we were tasked to work on statistical worksheet exercises. The purpose of this was to introduce us to the concept of inference and hypothesis testing by performing appropriate statistical tests using measures of location and spread. This was an individual exercise and allowed me to revisit my statistics knowledge which I have acquired mostly during my bachelor's degree. My professional experience did not involve statistical analysis, as it was mostly focused on project and people management.
					</p>
					<p>
						After completing the exercises, I was able to understand how I can apply the concepts of inference and hypothesis testing to a practical project such as my MSc Capstone thesis. It gave me a good overview of different testing approaches, such as a one- or two-tailed T test, or using an F test to compare statistical models and identify the model that fits the population best.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another interesting part of the exercise was data visualisation using graphs such as bar charts and histograms. I have worked a lot with Microsoft Excel in the past, both in my education and professional life. Although I enjoy working with graphs and Excel at large, I have not applied these methods for statistical analysis frequently. Once again, I understood more characteristics of the data through the graphs, as it helped me compare datasets and draw conclusions.

					<br>
					<p>
						The skills I have gained through these exercises can help me quantitatively analyse and interpret datasets for future research, such as during my thesis. These exercises built a great foundation for statistical analysis, however, in the future, I would also be keen to learn other methods of quantitative analysis. I can imagine as a dataset and the objectives of the researcher become more complex and multifaceted, these foundations might reach a limit and the analysis may need to incorporate more sophisticated testing methods and concepts.

					<p>
						<i>“Computing professionals' actions change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good”</i> (ACM, 2018).
					</p>
					<p>
						In the Research Methods and Professional Practice module, a key focus was laid on discussing ethical and legal implications in connection to research and the professional conduct of computing specialists. There were two discussion posts, both involving an exchange of ideas amongst peers, and an interesting debate on the presented case studies. We have discussed the principles of cyber law in a separate module; however, this was my first introduction to discussing ethics within the computing and research industry. 
					</p>
					<p>
						For the first collaborative discussion, I chose the “Malware Disruption” case study, as I thought this was a very interesting and current topic which involved both ACM Codes of Ethics and the BCS Code of Conduct. This case study made me aware of the risks involved in having web hosting services in countries without adequate laws. This instigated an interesting discussion on what actions should be taken after such an incident including long-term solutions to prevent future malicious acts. One idea that I thought of would be how international bodies could help implement a nationwide legal framework and relevant regulations for the country in the case study. In my opinion, I do not believe that these illegal services can be stopped without a robust legal framework and consequences in place. A code of ethics is a great guideline for professionals that want to act ethically, but malicious actors need further incentives.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second discussion involved a researcher named Abi who was placed in a difficult position while conducting data analysis for a cereal manufacturer. This case study highlighted the importance of objective and honest research that does not lead to advertising that deceives consumers. Through the discussion of this case study, I learned how to think objectively and critically to suggest the different actions that Abi can take. It was interesting to think about the ethical obligations for both research and computing professionals, as I have mostly considered legal repercussions when analysing similar case studies. While many of the ethical concepts are straightforward and intuitive, it is great to be able to use them as a guideline when unsure and can be applied in my professional career as an IT professional going forward.

					</div>
					<p>
						<i>As knowledge production in the field of research grows, it is hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and hence a literature review is more critical now than ever </i> (Snyder, 2019).
					</p>
					<p>
						A key part of the module was to conduct a literature review based on microservice architecture. The focus of this exercise was to illustrate the relevant and current knowledge on the topic, as well as to demonstrate my research and writing skills. I had never written a literature review before, and this was my first introduction to reading and evaluating various papers to identify relevant literature, for example on the benefits of using microservices over the more traditional monolithic approach. This process was a learning curve for me as I had to find papers with similar and differing viewpoints to write a holistic and critical review on the subject. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The literature review not only improved my research and writing skills, but also taught me how to find the right sources for my research project and read papers critically. After the assignment, I had a broad understanding of my topic and previous research, including its limitations. I also identified gaps in the literature that may be addressed in future research. I would have, however, liked to be even more critical when summarising the main viewpoints from each paper as I believe this aspect could be improved. I can also use the skills and knowledge gained through this assignment when I write a literature review for my master's thesis in the future.

						<h3 style="margin-bottom: 24px;margin-top: -1em;color:#1F3864">Skill Matrix and Action Plan</h3>
					<p>
						Looking back on this RMPP module, I have come to conclude that there has been significant progress in my research and writing skills. In my position as a student studying Cyber Security, I was primarily confident in my technical skills such as coding, but now I believe I have gained some more knowledge in how hypothesis testing can be used to analyse datasets, how codes of ethics can be the foundation for decision-making for computing professionals and how to identify relevant papers for a specific topic and critically review them. I was not expecting to learn so much at the beginning of this module as I had done academic research during my bachelor's degree, but that view changed as I delved deeper into the units of the module.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to help with my professional development, I have created a skill matrix excel sheet to provide an overview of skills I have acquired and developed in scope of my educational and professional experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						Based on the skill matrix, I have also established an action plan with certain areas of expertise and knowledge that I would like to improve on in the future.
