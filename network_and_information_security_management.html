							<h2>Network and Information Security Management</h2><br>
						</header>	
						<p>The Network and Information Security Management module at the University of Essex Online aims to teach fundamentals in security concepts and terminology, accompanied by hands-on practice in one of the most critical aspects of information security today &ndash; network technology. The module comprises of a core group project, namely an executive summary of a penetration test against another team&rsquo;s web application. The web application should be deployed as part of one of three domains:</p>
						<ol style="list-style-type:decimal;margin-left:41px;">
    						<span style="color:black;"><li style="margin-bottom: 0.25em;">An industry recruitment site that is used to allow candidates to register themselves on job vacancy sites.&nbsp;</li></span>
    						<span style="color:black;"><li style="margin-bottom: 0.25em;">An e-health site that is used to provide registrants with medical and fitness information and advice supplied by medical professionals.&nbsp;</li></span>
    						<span style="color:black;"><li style="margin-bottom: -0.5em;">An e-commerce site used to provide payment services and advice for commercial website operators.&nbsp;</li></span>
						</ol>
						<p>As an outcome, identified issues within the web application should be highlighted, together with an action plan to resolve critical vulnerabilities. In the case of the team we tested against, the domain e-Health has been chosen.</p><br>

        						1. Penetration Testing Tools and Frameworks
        						</span>
        					</strong>
        				</h1>
					</div>

					<p>A key aspect of interest was getting to know fundamental penetration testing tools and using them in practice. Penetration Testing is a field I have only explored a little before this module. I have attempted some CTF challenges in the past and went through a few Udemy courses; however, all things considered, I have only had a small insight into this exciting field.</p>

					<p>The module illustrated various testing frameworks, such as the Cyber Kill Chain that Lockheed Martin has developed. It is a widely adopted model, which breaks down a cyber-attack into seven distinct stages. Understanding the deployed tools and practices for each stage helps an organisation identify and combat advanced persistent threats, even in today&rsquo;s modernised threat landscape (Hutchins et al, 2011).</p>

					<p>Furthermore, throughout lecturecasts, seminars and further readings, tools for each stage of penetration testing were introduced. These ranged from tools such as NMAP for reconnaissance to Nessus for Automated Scanning and Slowloris for non-availability attacks.</p>

					<p>Even though the Cyber Kill Chain framework was a bit too extensive to use in our project, both of these foundations helped us as a team to decide on the sequence of testing and the suite of tools to use. We established a side-by-side comparison to evaluate the introduced tools and narrow down the selection (figure 1).</p>

					</center>
					<br>

					<p>During the last seminar, an important statement from a fellow student accurately described what I feel about the depth of knowledge within penetration testing: <i style="color: #0070C0;"> &ldquo;by doing this module I realised that hacking is not only very broad but can also be very deep. Broad and deep is a huge area to cover.&rdquo;</i></p>

					<p>With the number of tools that we worked with throughout this course, this statement resonated with me. Attack vectors such as SQL injections, for instance, seemed very easy to apply at first using automated tools such as SQLMap and Skipfish. However, when trying to apply them in practice, they didn&rsquo;t prove to be very effective. This led me to dig deeper and launch manual injection attacks using Burp Suite, which led me to read up about more sophisticated approaches, such as blind SQL injections that use time delays as indicators on whether an application is exploitable (PortSwigger, N.D.). In fact, Burp Suite is so extensive that PortSwigger, its creator, offers a whole free web academy and certification program that teaches users how to apply the suite to test against the most common web application vulnerabilities.</p>

					<p>A list of the output of deployed tools within the penetration test can be found <b><a href="#outputs" target=”_blank” style="color: #49bf9d;">here</a></b>.</p>

        						2. Cloud Computing using Amazon Web Services (AWS)
        						</span>
        					</strong>
        				</h1>
					</div>

					<p>As part of the project, we were tasked to launch our web application which the other team could test against. Our web app had to be deployed to do so. In this project, we were instructed to launch the PHP application using an AWS Ec2 instance. Practically applying the theoretical knowledge of cloud computing by deploying such an instance was very exciting.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>The modern paradigm of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is becoming increasingly important in the industry and society at large. The NISM module allowed me to run through the fundamentals and interact with the security aspects, for instance, setting up Security Groups and Roles and understanding how TCP/UDP ports are being opened and forwarded using the AWS console.</p>

					<p>The setup instructions we were given included a few intentional faux-pas by our tutor that we caught when deploying the instance. These were supposed to make it easier for the other team to test against our application. However, in an actual deployment, these should be strictly avoided. For instance, the web traffic was funnelled through port 80 (HTTP) and thus was not secured by SSL. Data transferred to and from the website is not encrypted and therefore susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Another issue was that the SSH port 22 was instructed to be open to the public. Anyone with the correct key pair is consequently able to connect to the server via the port. The best practice is to whitelist port 22 so that only specific IP addresses can connect to the server via SSH.</p>

					<br>
					<div style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>
        
        				<h1 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;'>
        					<strong>
        						<span style="color:#1F4E79;">
        						3. Further Improvements to Consider
        						</span>
        					</strong>
        				</h1>
					</div>

					<p>One aspect of the final executive summary I would like to have done differently, is the justification of impact for the individual issues and urgency of identified remedies. We have split the final report into equal portions that were then distributed to individual team members on a preferential basis. The summary of findings and the evaluation of impact and steps to resolve the most critical issues were taken up by a single member of the team. I felt, in the final report, especially the justification for ranking of the severeness of the identified issues was cut short and lacked a transparent methodology on how the ordinal ranking was decided. Even after a few back and forths, this was still the case, and we had to compromise on the final submitted report.&nbsp;</p>

					<p>During the beginning of the NISM module, we discussed the DREAD methodology and how it can be applied to score and rank individual threats. As an example, we read through a case study surrounding a medical mannequin and established a DREAD analysis for the exposed threats, which can be found 
					<b><a href="documents/nism_dread_analysis.pdf" target=”_blank” style="color: #49bf9d;">here</a></b>.</p>

					<p>Furthermore, throughout the penetration test, I worked with many CVE databases to look for potential exploits. I came across CVE scores for individual issues and vulnerabilities that we have found within the application throughout that process. Both of these approaches could have provided a simple yet effective and straightforward justification for the results.</p>

					<p>Another aspect that would be very interesting for me would be to conduct a penetration test on a similar application after improving my expertise working with tools such as Burp Suite and the Metasploit Framework. There is a lot to learn, and I have already started going through the first few lessons of the PortSwigger Web Security Academy. It would be exciting to see if I could get further than what we had accomplished throughout this project with the limited preliminary knowledge. This module showed me how fascinating the field of Penetration Testing is and what it encompasses. I can see myself working towards obtaining the Offensive Security OSCP certification after my studies.</p>
