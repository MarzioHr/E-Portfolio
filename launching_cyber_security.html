							<h2>Launching into Cyber Security</h2><br>
						</header>
						<p>
						Cyber Security is a global issue affecting society at all levels. The ever-increasing reliance on the Internet and the World Wide Web for almost every sphere of society - from e-commerce to healthcare provision, the dependence on Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-based critical services have all made Cyber Security a critical issue for institutions and governments globally (Maras, 2015; Botta et al., 2016). This has given rise to a growing demand for Cyber Security professionals equipped with the appropriate skills and knowledge to be able to combat the rising challenges within the cyberspace. This module will explore the security implications posed by interconnection and dependence on online services, and how security can be designed and embedded in systems for optimal protection.
						</p>	
						<p>
						The <b>Launching into Cyber Security</b> module covers core concepts and principles in the field of Cyber Security. Governance and ethical frameworks are discussed to develop important competencies that are required as a Cyber Security professional. The module enables students to engage, experience and envision current and future challenges in cyber security, while equipping them with the theoritical and practical skills needed to identify contemporary cyber security-based challenges and the ability to design best-practice solutions.

						The module started off with two seperate rounds of discussions amongst the peers. The first round of discussion revolved around why Cyber Security is now a global issue and why it is important for companies to invest in Cyber Security. We should consider the economic benefits to companies, the implications of a breach of regulations and laws such as reputational damage and trust and business competitiveness.<br /><br />

						<p>
						The second round of discussions were about security technologies and the context in which they can be employed. For our posts, we had to choose two of such technologies and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of deploying them. Personally, I chose to write my post about Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems and how they can provide companies and organisations with an additional layer of protection for their
						network infrastructures. <br /><br />

						To finish off the module, we were tasked with working on a real-life practical example. The aim of this deliverable is to apply the Cyber Security methods and techniques studied during the module to develop a solution to a business problem, which is as follows:
						<br><br>

						<i>Queens Medical Centre is a community clinic that acts as the first point of contact for any resident within its catchment area and it is facing difficulties managing the high volume of calls. The high call-volume is leading to long waiting times for patients and disrupting access to on-time care. Furthermore, the clinic administration is facing issues planning required resources to account for the community's rate of growth.
						<br><br>
						
						To address and mitigate these critical issues, that are impacting the centre and residents, the clinic's management has acquired a web-based appointment and scheduling management information system (ASMIS). Once implemented, the system will enable prospective patients to book their appointments online.
						<br><br></i>

						Our first task was to write a report to evaluate the proposed web-based ASMIS system in regards to potential cyber threats and how these can be mitigated. We were instructed to highlight potential abuse cases and secure design processes that may help mitigate the risks.<br /><br />

						As a second task, we had to implement some of the proposed solutions that we have previously highlighted in the report as actual code. This had to be done in Python using a MySQL database. For my project, I chose to implement secure authentication using Argon2 for password hashing, as well as a log/tracing database functionality to implement nonrepudiation and accountability.<br /><br />
