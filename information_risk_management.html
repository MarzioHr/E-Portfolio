							<h2>Information Risk Management</h2><br>
						</header>	
						<p>
						Information risk is a key business element that affects and impacts all aspects of a company.
						The <b>Information Risk Management (IRM)</b> module introduces the underpinning concepts and principles of IRM.  This includes a review of traditional and contemporary Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models, focusing on the areas most affected by risk management considerations. The course provides students with a combination of an understanding of IRM principles together with a review of assessment and mitigation techniques.

							The Information Risk Management (IRM) module included two separate rounds of discussion amongst the peers. The module began with a discussion round surrounding qualitative versus quantitative research approaches. Using an article written by Spears & Barki (2010), the advantages for each approach should be discussed. Furthermore, the advantages of involving users in the risk management process were part of the discussion. I decided to focus on the latter discussion. This helped set expectations for the upcoming case study. Due to the lack of given numerical data, a qualitative research mode would be most appropriate with the assistance of developing own assumptions and relating to secondary research.

						</p>
							
							
						<p>	
							The second round of discussions surrounded the effect of risks on the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). We were tasked to identify our personal top five overall causes of risk throughout the various stages of the SDLC. Outside of the discussion forum, the individual lists were exchanged within groups to arrive at a consensus. Afterwards, possible mitigations for the identified risk causes were then discussed. The NIST SP 800-160v1 framework guide by Ross et al (2018) was helpful especially for following up on mitigation options. Highlighting risk causes and mitigation options was very helpful for the risk idenfication of the group case study that followed.

							The main deliverable of the IRM module was a risk assessment report conducted on a fictional company called Acme Manufacturing. This was done in a group work setting. The given scenario was as follows:
						</p>

						<p><i>
							Acme manufacturing is an SME (Small/Medium Enterprise) employing 150 staff. It produces sporks for niche industries and due to increased demand, has decided to purchase an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to allow itself to more flexibly manage its supply chain. With this, the company should be able to scale production up or down to better meet demand.

							The company has shortlisted its selection down to 3 options:

							<li>A COTS (Commercial Off The Shelf) solution provided by a major manufacturer at a total cost (purchase plus support) of $100k per annum.</li>

							<li>An Open Source solution that will be installed and supported by their internal IT department, relying on community support for any escalations.</li>

							<li>An in-house created solution built by a student as part of her final year project and supported by the developer, as well as the internal IT department.</li>
						</p>

						<p>
							Currently, all the resource planning and scheduling are done via spreadsheets and that solution is becoming unwieldy.
						</i></p>

						<p>
							The first part of the case study consisted of writing a status report containing an overview of the intended information risk management work for the organisation. The status report should detail the possible information risk management related problems that have been identified. Furthermore, it should outline business challenges, the existing model and then highlight what information risk management theories and practices should be utilised on this project.
						</p>

						<p>
							As a team, we decided early on that we would allocate one short-listed solution to each team member. We first outlined the table of contents and estimated work effort. Afterwards, we distributed the tasks equally during a team meeting. The biggest challenge for writing this brief overview, was staying within the tight 600-word limit. 
						</p>

							<a href="documents/Acme Manufacturing - Status Report.pdf" target=”_blank”><b style="color:#49bf9d">View Status Report: "Acme Manufacturing ERP Solution"</b></a>
						</p>


						<p>
							The second part consisted of writing the actual risk assessment report. The aim of this deliverable was to apply the Information Risk Management techniques studied in the course to the problem as described and evaluate the results. As a team, we first had to identify the risks of each solution, then analyse and assess them and finally recommend the most suitable one to Acme. We were also tasked with providing a Disaster Recovery Plan for the recommended solution with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 15 minutes and a recovery time objective (RTO) of four hours. 
						</p>

						<p>
							As outlined above in the discussion posts section, due to lack of numerical data, we opted to go for a qualitative research approach. However, this would make assessing and comparing the risks of each solution rather difficult. To overcome this issue, we decided to use the NIST SP 800-30 framework as a foundation. The risk-level matrix within was a perfect fit allowing the application of a scoring system and comparing identified risks according to their likelihood of occurrence and their magnitude of impact on the business.

						<p>
							As the last task within the IRM module, we looked at future trends and current issues for the risk management process. The NSA list a series of ‘hard problems’ that “require (security) science as a community to focus (on) and measure their progress” (NSA, 2020). These problems concern:
							
							<ol>
								<li>Scalability and composability</li>
								<li>Policy governed secure collaboration</li>
								<li>Security metrics driven SDLC</li>
								<li>Resilient architectures</li>
								<li>Understanding and accounting for human behaviour (NSA, 2020)</li>
							</ol>
						</p>

						<p>
							Every student was assigned to write a wiki entry for the issues discussed and the issues that were part of the unit reading. Learning about the on-going reseachin the IRM field was very interesting for me. I chose to explain the issue of risk information misrepresentation.
						</p>

						<p>
							In conclusion, this group project was a learning experience for me. It proved vital to give everyone a chance to share ideas while respecting all opinions, especially knowledge from various industries and backgrounds. However, it was not always easy to facilitate discussion among the team. For upcoming group work, establishing a meeting chair and enforcing it might help overcome this challenge.
						</p>
						<p>
							Separating the report by the individual solutions worked well, albeit varying in style. In the future, however, I would try splitting the report based on background instead (e.g. technical, operations, management). This could increase contributions even further, especially if members feel more comfortable discussing their area of expertise.
